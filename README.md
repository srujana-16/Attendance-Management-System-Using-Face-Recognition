# Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition
This project entails developing an attendance system that uses facial recognition to record students' presence and time-in. It includes facial detection, alignment, and recognition, as well as the creation of a web application to support the system's many use cases, such as registration, photo addition to the dataset, reading attendance reports, and so on.

The goal of this project is to automate the traditional attendance method, which involves manually marking attendance. The system's digitalization wouldÂ help to improve data visualisation by employing graphs to show the number of students present today, total classes attended, in-time, and other metrics, as well as decrease manual process errors. Its enhanced features make it a viable upgrade and replacement for older attendance systems.
